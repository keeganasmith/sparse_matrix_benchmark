What i've tried:

matrix vector multiplication w/compression: worked, except compression was
using more memory on reduced dram node. 

matrix vector multiplication w/o compression: worked, however memory usage was
far too low, and execution time was too quick (~3 seconds)

solving sparse matrix linear system: worked, however memory usage was lacking,
and cholmod_analyze takes too long with larger matrices b/c it only uses one
core.

multiplying sparse matrices: in progress
